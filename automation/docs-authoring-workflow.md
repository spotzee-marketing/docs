# Documentation authoring workflow

Use this workflow for every new, moved, or materially edited reader-facing documentation page or prose block. Complete the placement gate before writing and the humanisation finalisation gate before release when the change qualifies.

## Spotzee release boundaries

Keep Guides, Main API and Extended API as separate tabs. Generate endpoint contracts from their owning OpenAPI sources; put tasks and explanations in Guides. Keep SDKs and integration guidance before secondary tools. Preserve moved public URLs with redirects.

Give every top-level navigation group an icon from the configured icon library. API groups list explicit `METHOD /path` entries in `pages` so their icons and order render; `tag` is a display badge, not an OpenAPI tag selector. When public endpoints are added, renamed or removed, reconcile both API tabs with their owning specifications and verify endpoint coverage and existing page URLs.

Public SDK and integration names needed to install or use them are approved, including language, runtime and framework names in that public-tooling context. This exception does not permit disclosure of backend implementation, storage, infrastructure or internal source paths. Verify every public term against its reader task.

Audit every existing page and both generated references against owning source and deployed behaviour. Record keep, correct, rewrite, merge, move or retire, plus source evidence and verification state. Retain accurate pages. A source-only review is not deployed verification. Hold a coordinated release until every batch passes, the operator deploys the API/worker changes, and the live specifications match.

## Product updates

Keep `/changelog` as the product-wide release feed: `title: "Product updates"`, a reader-facing description and `rss: true`, without `noindex`. Link it once from `docs.json` → `navbar.links`; keep it out of sidebar groups. The RSS feed is `/changelog/rss.xml`.

For a released feature, changed behaviour, customer-visible fix, or public API/SDK change, update the affected guides and references as well as the changelog. Check the owning product change and release evidence before writing; do not infer a release from a draft plan or an unmerged change. If documentation does not need an update, record the reason in the product change's documentation-impact receipt.

The product repository owns what shipped; this repository owns presentation. Verify every claim against the owning implementation and release evidence. Record source citations privately; publish only customer-facing behaviour and required actions. Preserve qualifications, limits and existing release history. Apply the confidentiality and finalisation gates below.

Use existing `changelog.mdx` entries as the format examples:

- Wrap each release in `<Update label="D Month YYYY" tags={[...]} rss={{ title: "..." }}>`, newest first. Labels contain dates, without version numbers.
- Use only `New features`, `Improvements` and `Bug fixes` as tags.
- Order sections as named-feature `##` headings, `## Improvements`, then `## Bug fixes`; omit sections with no changes.
- Write each item as a standalone prose paragraph, without bullet points. Use Australian English and sentence case, and explain the effect on the reader.
- Give `rss.title` a standalone summary. Link to the affected guide for instructions rather than duplicating the guide.
- Keep API-version identifiers in the relevant entry or versioning guide; the feed covers the whole product.

Before release, verify the rendered entries, tag filters, RSS link and navigation placement, then run the repository's validation gates. Documentation-only styling and navigation changes need no invented product release entry.

## 1. Read before writing

1. Read repository-root `AGENTS.md`, local `CLAUDE.md` when present, and the active session plan.
2. Read the complete `navigation` tree in `docs.json`; do not inspect only the page's current group.
3. Search all MDX, snippets, OpenAPI prose, and redirects for the subject and its synonyms.
4. Read two or three sibling pages that serve the same reader task.
5. Verify technical and product claims from their owning source. The verified pre-humanisation copy is the frozen baseline.

## 2. Decide the information architecture

Record this block in the task plan before creating or materially editing content:

```text
Placement: Tab → group → subgroup → page
Disposition: keep, move, split, or merge
Reader task: <one sentence>
Sibling fit: <why these neighbouring pages belong together>
Sequence fit: <why the parent group appears before and after its neighbours>
```

For an existing page, reconsider its full scope after the planned edit. Prior placement is evidence, not proof that the page remains correctly placed.

Use these placement tests:

- Each level represents a distinct reader choice or task domain.
- Sibling pages answer related questions at the same conceptual level.
- The file path, navigation path, page title, breadcrumb, and related links tell the same story.
- Page count does not determine category boundaries. Create a group only when it clarifies the reader's choice.
- Add a group root only when readers need an introduction or decision page before choosing a child page.
- Prefer the shallowest hierarchy that preserves those distinctions; never flatten distinct tasks merely to reduce depth.

Audit sequence as well as placement whenever a top-level group is added, moved, renamed, or materially changed:

- Order groups by the reader journey and primary audience, not by when content was added.
- Put primary-audience workflows immediately after implementation tools.
- Keep paired core workflows adjacent.
- Put required prerequisites before the task they unblock; optional configuration may follow the core workflow.
- Keep operational guidance after the workflows it observes, then use cases and general integrations, with administration last.

When one option clearly passes every test, you may keep, move, split, merge, or create a group inside an existing tab without another approval. Adding, removing, renaming, or redefining a top-level tab is an information-architecture decision for the operator.

When moving a page:

1. Align its file path with the approved hierarchy.
2. Add a top-level Mintlify redirect in `docs.json` from every old public path to the new path.
3. Update affected root-relative internal links, cards, and related-page navigation.
4. Verify that no duplicate page remains under the old category.

## 3. Structure the page around the reader's task

Use only sections that help the reader complete the task. Where applicable, progress from what the feature is, to how it works, configuration, ongoing operations, troubleshooting, and related next steps.

Keep one reader intent per page. Split a page when its sections serve different navigation destinations or reader goals; merge pages when they duplicate one task and neither has an independent purpose.

## 4. Determine whether humanisation is required

Humanisation is required when the change adds reader-facing prose, changes sentence meaning or structure, or replaces a complete visible sentence or paragraph in shipped MDX, OpenAPI-rendered prose, snippets, or changelog prose.

Humanisation is not required for an exact technical-token correction, metadata-only edit, punctuation-only edit, generated artifact, code-only change, or agent-only instruction. Record `Humanisation: skipped — <exact exemption>` when skipping it.

This workflow enables the canonical contract's `ineligible-technical` disposition for documentation and technical guides. Apply the contract's complete criteria before any provider call and only to one atomic technical-reference paragraph or list item. Do not exempt a whole page or section, or any explanatory, tutorial, transitional, or promotional prose, merely because it discusses a technical subject. Preserve a qualifying unit byte-identically and record its source evidence, protected assertions, manual checks, and eligibility reason in the ledger.

Historical `reference-class` ledgers remain byte-identical evidence only. They do not authorise a material edit or replace the ledger required by the canonical contract.

## 5. Apply the canonical finalisation contract

Read the organisation’s private humanisation finalisation contract before finalisation. Obtain it from the documentation maintainer if it is not available in the working environment. Its eligibility, transport, repair, retry, scoring, and ledger rules are authoritative.

Inventory the prose units and freeze their protected spans. Use the contract's `ineligible-manual` route for qualifying short units or a whole piece below the submission floor, preserving source bytes and recording manual checks. Process eligible submissions through **detect, humanise, repair, re-detect, ledger**. Follow the contract's reviewer decision for retries and its conditions for retaining the reviewed source; provider errors require `blocked-manual-review` with the exact error.

This workflow additionally protects supplied SEO and long-tail keywords, technical entities, code tokens, commands, URLs, source links, numbers, units, product/protocol/provider names, schema fields, verified factual claims, frontmatter, heading hierarchy, code, tables, list structure, image markup, FAQ questions, link destinations, Australian English, and the repository's concise developer-docs voice.

Record exactly one disposition per unit in a hash-bound ledger, with zero `blocked-manual-review` rows before release. Keep source citations, provider output and detailed review files in private storage; preserve historical ledgers byte-identically. This repository is public: `.mintignore` excludes files from the website only. Track only public-safe workflow rules, page IDs, hashes, dispositions and validation summaries here.

## 6. Pass the preservation gate

Fail the gate if any protected occurrence is reduced without an explicit, task-authorised correction. A passing ledger does not replace these preservation checks.

Compare the frozen baseline and final copy and confirm:

- Frontmatter, heading hierarchy, code, tables, list structure, image markup, FAQ questions, and link destinations retain their intended structure.
- Supplied keyword, technical-entity, source-link, factual-claim, number, unit, product/protocol/provider, and schema-field occurrence counts do not decrease.
- Every factual rewrite remains equivalent to its verified baseline and source.
- No qualification, limit, warning, prerequisite, or reader instruction changes accidentally.
- The final copy still satisfies the page's title, description, keywords, direct-answer structure, and internal-link intent.

Read baseline and final copy side by side once more. The gate passes only when every difference is intentional and supported.

## 7. Verify and report

Run every repository gate that applies, including confidentiality, external-link, Mintlify validation, broken links, and rendered preview checks. Humanisation evidence never replaces technical verification or browser review.

Report:

```text
Placement: <tab → group → subgroup → page>
Disposition: <keep | move | split | merge>
Humanisation: <skipped — exact exemption | finalised — dispositions and ledger path | held — blocked-manual-review count and exact reason>
Preservation: <protected counts unchanged; claims verified>
Status: <checks and release state>
```
